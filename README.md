# Credit_Risk_Analysis

The overall purpose for this analysis is to predict credit risk and the determine the borrower’s level of risk. This technique is used across financial intuitions to determine credit risk before the financial intuition issues a loan to the borrower.
In this module we are looking to determine which model has the highest accuracy score determining and to overfitting we need to be aware of in the process. 

We compared two algorithms in the Oversampling portion – RandomOverSampler and Smote Overslamping.
Undersampling  algorithms the data using the ClusterCentroids were used to compare with the oversampling data. 
The final analysis I used the combination of both undersampling and SMOTEEN algorithm. A compariason of the two that reduces biases and demonstrates the performance of each by checking the accuracy scores.
Oversmapling accuracy score: 62%
SMOTE Oversampling: 65%
Undersampling: 66%
Combination: 66%
With these results a precision of 1% and an average accuracy score of 64%.
Overall the accuracy score isn’t strong enough to predict credit risk. As a financial instution I would want to have a beter model with higher accuracy to use as a predicting tool.
